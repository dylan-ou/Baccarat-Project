# Baccarat-Project

This project was developed with Krystian Stanuch for CS 342: Software Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago. This program simulated a game of Baccarat, which is a simple card game that only requires a player and the dealer (the dealer's logic is dealt with in the program).
